<p style="color:white;text-align:justify;font-family:serif;"> In this quarter, i have learned a lot of new things. This first quarter has been both very exciting and challenging, as we were faced with unfamiliar lessons and sometimes difficult projects. There were also lots of new discoveries, just like how to add different objects to your website, which makes it a lot more organized and clean to look at. Our lessons have given us a deeper understanding and added depth to coding, which makes it complicated yet a lot easier to do. These lessons will definitely come in handy as time goes by and more coding will be needed in our lives. I will make sure to bring these lessons with me as i grow older because this will help me in different aspects, just like in getting a job, or just a way to pass time. This quarter has been overall a great and productive quarter that started a new journey for all of us, and I am excited to see what comes next. </p>
